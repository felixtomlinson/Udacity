        <h1>Notes from first part of my nanodegree (for submission)</h1>
        <h2> Elements that can be used in HTML </h2>

          b for bold <br>
          em for emphasis (italics)<br>
          a for link<br>
          <tag attr="value"> contents </tag><br>
          img for image<br>
          <img src="url"alt="text"> <br>
          br for break (also a viod tag)<br>
          p for paragraph - not a void tag needs to be closed<br>
          Span inline, div in block - but do the same. Add class (CSS class, for styles)<br>

      </p>
      <span>
        <h2> General Notes </h2>

        <b> Computers are stupid </b> - they have no ambiguity<br>
        What is an href? Attribute name<br>
        Formatting is redundant<br>
        Img have no closing tag (void tag) <br>
        br tag inline, p block. Blocks can have hight and width.<br>
        Inline vs block important distinction.<br>
        So far everything inline (except p).<br>
        <b> Container elements: </b> elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside themselves<br>
        span div control how text laid out <br>
        Most pages have a doctype, head, body <br>
        Main focus is the body (CSS and Java Script outside this)<br>
        Indentation important<br>
        <b>People need to read code too.</b> <br>
      </span>
    </body>
