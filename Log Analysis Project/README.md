Log Analysis Project Readme
=======

In order to run the Log_Analysis_Project.py you must first save it into your vagrant file. 
This must be the same place where you have saved newsdata.sql.

Then you load your vagrant virtual machine by running vagrant up and then vagrant ssh from the command line 
when you are in the vagrant directory.

You then write cd \vagrant into the command line of the virtual machine.

Finally you put python Log_Analysis_Project.py into your command line and the file should run.
