        <h1>Notes from first part of my nanodegree (for submission)</h1>
        <h2> Elements that can be used in HTML </h2>

          b for bold <br>
          em for emphasis (italics)<br>
          a for link<br>
          <tag attr="value"> contents </tag><br>
          img for image<br>
          <img src="url"alt="text"> <br>
          br for break (also a viod tag)<br>
          p for paragraph - not a void tag needs to be closed<br>
          Span inline, div in block - but do the same. Add class (CSS class, for styles)<br>

      </p>
      <span>
        <h2> General Notes </h2>

        <b> Computers are stupid </b> - they have no ambiguity<br>
        What is an href? Attribute name<br>
        Formatting is redundant<br>
        Img have no closing tag (void tag) <br>
        br tag inline, p block. Blocks can have hight and width.<br>
        Inline vs block important distinction.<br>
        So far everything inline (except p).<br>
        <b> Container elements: </b> elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside themselves<br>
        span div control how text laid out <br>
        Most pages have a doctype, head, body <br>
        Main focus is the body (CSS and Java Script outside this)<br>
        Indentation important<br>
        <b>People need to read code too.</b> <br>
      
      </span>
      <p>
        <h1>Notes from the second part of my nanodegree</h1>
        <h2> General notes </h2>

         HTML CSS and Javascript all have different purposes<br>
         <br>
         <Strong>HTML - structure<br>
         CSS - style <br>
         Javascript - interactive elements <br> </strong><br>
         Tree like structure <br>
         HTML - language, tags turned into elements forming a tree <br>
         Document object model - standard convention for representing and interacting with html <br>
         CSS allows you to say all X with class should look like Y <br>
         Once you know language, you will have idea as to what it will look like. <br>
         <b>Everything is a box</b> <br>
         Thinking in terms of boxes makes your life as front end web developer much easier <br>
         Grid helps to make sure everything is aligned <br>
         Start with the big boces and move down from there <br>
         Classes are labels on boxes - remind you. Can belong to multiple classes <br>
         <br>

         <h2> Example of divs </h2> 
         <div class="title">
           My app
         </div>
         <div class="app">
           <div class="screenshot">
             Image
           </div>
           <div class="description">
             Text
           </div>
         </div>
         <br>
         I haven't quite worked out what difference all the above makes.
         It took me half an hour to get exactly the same piece of code out of a zip file because Udacity don't seem to be aware that Ubuntu exists
