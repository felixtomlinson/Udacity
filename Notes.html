        <h2> Elements that can be used in HTML </h2>

          b for bold <br>
          em for emphasis (italics)<br>
          a for link<br>
          <tag attr="value"> contents </tag><br>
          img for image<br>
          <img src="url"alt="text"> <br>
          br for break (also a viod tag)<br>
          p for paragraph - not a void tag needs to be closed<br>
          Span inline, div in block - but do the same. Add class (CSS class, for styles)<br>

      </p>
      <span>
        <h2> General Notes </h2>

        <b> Computers are stupid </b> - they have no ambiguity<br>
        What is an href? Attribute name<br>
        Formatting is redundant<br>
        Img have no closing tag (void tag) <br>
        br tag inline, p block. Blocks can have hight and width.<br>
        Inline vs block important distinction.<br>
        So far everything inline (except p).<br>
        <b> Container elements: </b> elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside themselves<br>
        span div control how text laid out <br>
        Most pages have a doctype, head, body <br>
        Main focus is the body (CSS and Java Script outside this)<br>
        Indentation important<br>
        <b>People need to read code too.</b> <br>
      
      </span>
      <p>
        HTML CSS and Javascript all have different purposes<br>
      <br>
      <Strong>HTML - structure<br>
      CSS - style <br>
      Javascript - interactive elements <br> </strong><br>
      Tree like structure <br>
      HTML - language, tags turned into elements forming a tree <br>
      Document object model - standard convention for representing and interacting with html <br>
      CSS allows you to say all X with class should look like Y <br>
      Once you know language, you will have idea as to what it will look like. <br>
      <b>Everything is a box</b> <br>
      Thinking in terms of boxes makes your life as front end web developer much easier <br>
      Grid helps to make sure everything is aligned <br>
      Start with the big boces and move down from there <br>
      Classes are labels on boxes - remind you. Can belong to multiple classes <br>
      Avoid repetition <br>
      CSS stands fro cascading style sheets <br>
      Several sheets can be references from same HMTL. <br>
      Most specific rules applied. Go through elements until you find most specific one. <br>
      CSS write selector, select HTML tag and apply to all tags <br>
      p { } would apply to all paragraphs <br>
      apply to a class .X {X:X;} <br>
      Learn more about colours and how to define them? More specific than generic colours. CSS has a lot of functionality. <br>
      Call lots of different types of colours and fonts. <br>
      Everything betwee { } is a <strong>rule</strong> <br>
      The line of code that says background-color : black; is a <strong>declaration</strong>. background-color is a <strong>property</strong> and black is the <strong>value</strong> of that property. <br>
      Use Classes to differentiate different styles for different parts of the document <br>
      Can write CSS at the top of your HTML document <br>
      Can link to CSS in a separate file <br>
      Can write your style inline in html <br>
      Semantic conventions often associated with styles <br>
      There are default style types <br>
      Box model - margins, borders, padding, content.<br>
      Content - image or text. Nucleus (protected by other things, don't overlap or look to close)<br>
      Padding - green colour, clears an area around the content, affected by background colour of box <br>
      Border - around padding and content - colour of box <br>
      Margin - round the box - totally transparent, space around boxes. <br>
      Can play around with width of all of these things.<br>
      Size of element equal to whole thing. <br>
      Difficult to know how much apace box will take. <br>
      *{box-sizing: border-box;} includes border and boxes - size of box will always stay the same. Margin not included. <br>
      Drawback if you want to make sure older browsers can display it - browser specific instructions ahead of border-box <br>
      e.g. -webkit-box-etc., -moz-etc., -ms-etc. <br>
      Set size as pixel or percentage. Percentage changes to screen size. <br>
      Max width <br>
      Positioning complicated <br>
      Flexbox <br>
      Parent container to value flex : element.style {display: flex;} <br>
      <b>Code, test, refine</b> <br>
      Boxify, tag, size of boxes, how to position on screen, general layout. Then smaller details. <br>
      Look for natural boxes <br>
      Look for repeated styles and semantic elements <br>
      Write html <br>
      Apply styles <br>
      Fix things <br>

      I haven't quite worked out what difference all the above makes.
